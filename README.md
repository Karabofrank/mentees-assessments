# mentees-assessments


I recommend you start with problems1 folder then pyramids1 but please, before pyramids please watch the playlist I am going to share. 
Don't watch all the videos, focus on the triangles & squares. Then do pyramids1. 
Try treating this as a real assessment because hm, it really won't be easy on Thursday. 

Remember to follow the respective README files of the folders for instructions!!!
